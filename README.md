# BSQ
The goal of the project is to find the biggest possible square on a board, while avoiding obstacles.

• The board will be given to you in a file, passed as an argument to your program.
• The board is composed of lines of ’.’ and ’o’.
• The first line of the file is a number indicating the number of lines in the board.
• All lines have the same length.
• The board will always be a rectangle.
• There will always be at least one line of at least one cell.
• At the end of every line, there is a ’\n’.
